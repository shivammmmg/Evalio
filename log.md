### ITR1-5 — Minimum Required Score Calculation

([SCRUM-59](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-59))

**Story Owner:** Rima  
**Planned Effort:** 8 hours  
**Actual Effort:** 6 hours

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to know the minimum score I need on a remaining assessment to achieve a target final grade, so that I can plan my effort realistically.

#### Scope (ITR1)

- User provides a target final grade (0–100)
- System calculates the minimum required score on ONE remaining assessment
- Calculation assumes all other remaining assessments receive maximum possible scores (100%).
- Assumes all other remaining assessments receive maximum possible scores
- If the required score is above 100, the target is marked as not achievable
- Uses stub / in-memory data only

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

- Multiple remaining assessments at once
- Strategy recommendations
- Saving or comparing targets

##### Development Tasks & Assignments

1. Backend: Calculate minimum required score for target grade (SCRUM-60)

   - Assignee: Kartik

2. Backend: API endpoint for minimum required score (SCRUM-61)

   - Assignee: Kartik

3. Frontend: Minimum required score display (SCRUM-62)

   - Assignee: Rima

4. Tests: Unit tests for minimum required logic (SCRUM-63)

   - Assignee: Bardiya

5. Docs: Update log.md for minimum required score logic (SCRUM-64)
   - Assignee: Rima

#### Notes / Reflection

- **Design Decision:** Implemented an "Optimistic Projection" model. This assumes the user will achieve 100% on all other future assessments to calculate the absolute minimum effort required for the selected task.
- **Frontend Integration:** Linked the calculation to the Dashboard Assessment Breakdown, ensuring that if a target is mathematically impossible (>100% required), the UI clearly flags the goal as "Not Achievable."
- **Edge Cases:** Handled scenarios where a user has already achieved their target grade before all assessments are completed.

### ITR1-6 — What-If Scenario Analysis (Stretch)

([SCRUM-65](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-65))

**Story Owner:** Bardiya  
**Planned Effort:** 6 hours  
**Actual Effort:** 8 hours

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to temporarily try a hypothetical score on a remaining assessment,  
so that I can see how it would affect my final grade.

#### Scope (ITR1 – Stretch)

- User inputs **ONE** hypothetical score for **ONE** remaining assessment
- System calculates projected grade impact using existing weighted-grade logic
- Hypothetical data is **NOT saved or persisted** (read-only analysis)
- Uses stub / in-memory data only

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

- Multiple what-if scenarios
- Saving/comparing scenarios
- Charts/projections
- Natural language / AI inputs

#### Development Tasks & Assignments

1. Backend: Add what-if scenario calculation function (read-only; no persistence)

   - Assignee: Kartik

2. Backend: Add API endpoint for what-if scenario analysis (`/courses/{course_index}/whatif`)

   - Assignee: Kartik

3. Tests: Unit tests for what-if scenario logic

   - Assignee: Bardiya

4. Docs: Update log.md to mark this story as a stretch feature and document the no-persistence decision

   - Assignee: Bardiya

5. Frontend: What-if input (slider or number) and result display (Explore Scenarios page), and UX/UI Design
   - Assignee: Shadi

#### Notes / Reflection

- **Design decision (scope control):** hypothetical values are intentionally **not persisted** in ITR1.
- Implemented as read-only scenario analysis using existing standing/weight calculations.
- Main work on this story was split: **backend implementation by Kartik**, and **tests + documentation by Bardiya**.

## 4. Major Design Decisions

During Iteration 1, the team made the following architectural and design decisions:

### 1. Three-Layer Architecture

The system was structured using a three-layer architecture:

- UI Layer (Frontend)
- Business Logic Layer
- Data Layer (Stub Database)

This separation ensures clear responsibilities and prevents business logic from being placed inside the UI.

### 2. Stub Database with Interface

A database interface was created along with a stub (in-memory) implementation.
This allows the system to switch to a real persistent database in future iterations with minimal changes.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

- Business logic (grade calculations, feasibility logic) was implemented strictly in the service layer.
- UI layer is responsible only for user input and displaying results.
- Data layer handles storage via stub implementation.

### 4. Unit Testing Strategy

Unit tests were written for domain and business logic classes.
Database-dependent logic was tested using the stub implementation.

### 5. Controlled Scope for Iteration 1

Advanced grading rules and persistent database were intentionally deferred to later iterations to maintain focus on core functionality.

### 6. Grading Validation Rules (SCRUM-45)

The following validation rules were implemented for grading structure integrity:

**Assessment Weight Validation:**

- Weights must be non-negative (≥ 0)
- Total weight must equal exactly 100%
- Each assessment must have a unique name

**Grade Entry Validation:**

- Grades must be numeric values
- Raw score must be ≥ 0
- Total score must be > 0
- Raw score cannot exceed total score
- Both raw_score and total_score must be provided together, or both null

**What-If Scenario Validation (SCRUM-66/67):**

- Hypothetical scores must be between 0-100%
- Assessment must exist and be ungraded
- Read-only operation - does not persist data

**Minimum Required Score Validation (SCRUM-60/61):**

- Target must be between 0-100%
- Assessment must exist and be ungraded
- Returns `is_achievable: false` if required score exceeds 100%

## 5. Concerns / Issues

- No major group conflicts occurred during Iteration 1.
- Initial time estimates for some stories were higher than actual effort required.
- Minor integration adjustments were needed between backend and frontend components.
- No critical blockers affected completion of ITR1 stories.

## 6. Iteration Summary

Total number of user stories implemented: 6

All planned ITR1 user stories were completed within the iteration timeline.

Overall planned effort aligned closely with actual effort, with some stories completed faster than estimated.

The team successfully delivered:

- Domain models
- Stub database implementation
- Basic GUI for ITR1 stories
- Unit tests for business logic
- Structured Jira tracking

Iteration 1 goals were met successfully, and the system remains stable with no major defects.

## 2. Plan Review (ITR1 → ITR2)

At the beginning of Iteration 2, the team reviewed the results and scope of Iteration 1 and confirmed that the overall project direction for Evalio remained unchanged.

The team decided to continue building on the existing foundation from ITR1 rather than changing the core vision or architecture. The main focus of ITR2 was to extend the system with additional planned functionality.

Compared to ITR1:

* The overall project direction remained the same.
* New ITR2 user stories were added based on the planned next phase of development.
* No previously planned ITR1 stories were significantly changed or redefined.
* No major priority changes were introduced during ITR2 planning.
* No major scope reductions or dropped items were identified at the planning stage.

The team proceeded with ITR2 by expanding the system with the next set of planned features while keeping the original Evalio concept and structure consistent.

## 3. Task Assignment & Work Breakdown (ITR2)

### ITR2-1 — Automatic Course Evaluation Extraction (AI-Optional & Robust Design)

([SCRUM-95](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-95))

**Story Owner:** Shivam Gupta  
**Planned Effort:** 5–6 days  
**Actual Effort:** 4 days

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to upload my course outline (PDF or image) and automatically extract assessment components, weight percentages, and grading rules, so that I can quickly and accurately set up my course evaluation without manually entering all grading details.

#### Scope (ITR2)

* AI is used only to assist in extracting structured grading information.
* Core evaluation logic remains independent and fully functional without AI.
* User can upload a course outline in supported file formats.
* System extracts assessment components such as:

  * Tests
  * Quizzes
  * Assignments
  * Exams
* System extracts corresponding weight percentages for each assessment.
* System detects supported grading rules such as:

  * Best X of Y
  * Drop Lowest
* Extracted information is converted into structured grading data.
* Extracted grading structure is shown in an editable preview screen.
* User can:

  * edit assessment names
  * modify weight percentages
  * adjust grading rule parameters
* System requires explicit user confirmation before saving extracted data.
* System validates extracted data before saving, including:

  * no negative weights
  * valid total weight
  * logical consistency of grading rules
* Manual setup remains available if extraction fails or AI is unavailable.
* Core grading calculations must continue working correctly without AI extraction.

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

* Advanced grading rule semantics such as mandatory pass requirements and bonus-cap behavior.
* Institution-specific extraction customization beyond the currently supported grading rule patterns.
* Fully automatic correction of ambiguous or incomplete course outlines without user review.
* AI-driven academic recommendations based on extracted course data.

8. Docs: Update `log.md`

   * Assignee: Shivam ([SCRUM-104](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-104))

#### Notes / Reflection

* Implemented a modular backend extraction pipeline to support multiple file types and improve maintainability.
* Added PDF parsing and OCR fallback to support scanned or low-quality course outlines.
* Ensured extracted data is not persisted automatically and only saved after explicit user confirmation.
* Validation and confirmation flow improved reliability by preventing invalid extracted structures from being accepted directly.
* AI was limited to extraction support only, while all grading and evaluation logic remained deterministic and independent of AI.
* No major blockers were encountered, although extraction robustness required handling inconsistent formatting across different course outline documents.

### ITR2-2 — Persistent Multi-Course Planning System (DB + Multi-Course Support)

([SCRUM-96](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-95))

**Story Owner:** Himanshi Verma  
**Planned Effort:** 4–5 days  
**Actual Effort:** 5 days

#### Story Description

As a student, when I manage my courses, I want my courses, grades, and what-if scenarios to be saved permanently so that I can track and plan my academic performance across sessions without losing data between sessions.

#### Scope (ITR2)

* Course persistence:
  * Save extracted course structure, including assessments, weights, and grading rules.

### ITR2-3 — Universal GPA Converter (4.0, 9.0, & 10.0 Scales)

([SCRUM-109](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-109))

**Story Owner:** Kartik Sharma  
**Planned Effort:** 3–4 days  
**Actual Effort:** 3 days

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to convert my course percentages and YorkU grade points into various standardized GPA scales (4.0, 9.0, and 10.0), so that I can assess my academic standing for graduate school applications, internships, and internal university requirements.

#### Scope (ITR2)

* Multi-scale GPA support:
  * Implement conversion logic for the OMSAS 4.0 scale.
  * Implement conversion logic for the YorkU 9.0 scale.
  * Implement conversion logic for a standard 10.0 scale used in international conversions.

* Weighted GPA calculation:
  * Calculate cumulative GPA (cGPA) by weighting course grade points using course credit values.
  * Support GPA calculations across multiple manually supplied courses.
  * Distinguish between term GPA and cumulative GPA use cases.

* Visual data representation:
  * Provide a summary view comparing student standing across all three GPA scales.
  * Show a clear conversion path such as percentage → letter grade → GPA value.

* System agnosticism:
  * Ensure the converter works for both actual grades and what-if scenarios.
  * Keep GPA conversion logic decoupled from the UI so additional scales can be added in future iterations.

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

* Institution-specific custom GPA scale definitions beyond the supported 4.0, 9.0, and 10.0 systems.
* Transcript-style GPA exports or official reporting formats.
* Persisting GPA history over time.
* Automatic GPA recalculation triggers tied to all course updates across the system.

#### Development Subtasks & Assignments

1. Backend: Implement GPA Conversion Logic (4.0 / 9.0 / 10.0 scales)  
   * Assignee: Kartik ([SCRUM-109](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-109))

2. Frontend: GPA Summary Component & Scale Toggle  
   * Assignee: Rima ([SCRUM-111](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-111))

3. Frontend: UI/UX Design in Figma  
   * Assignee: Shadi ([SCRUM-129](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-129))

4. Tests: Unit tests for boundary cases (e.g., 79.4% vs 79.5%)  
   * Assignee: Bardiya ([SCRUM-113](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-113))

5. Docs: Update API documentation for GPA endpoints  
   * Assignee: Kartik ([SCRUM-114](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-114))

6. Database: Support GPA Conversion Data  
   * Assignee: Himanshi ([SCRUM-119](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-119))

#### Acceptance Criteria

* The system accurately converts a percentage to the correct grade point on the 4.0, 9.0, and 10.0 scales.
* Users can include course credit weights so cumulative GPA calculations are weighted correctly.
* The dashboard displays a side-by-side comparison of all three scales.
* GPA calculations update correctly for what-if scenarios.
* The system handles non-numeric grades such as Pass/Fail or Withdrawn without breaking the calculation engine.

#### Notes / Reflection

* Designed the GPA conversion engine as a stateless backend module so that conversion logic remains reusable and independent of the frontend.
* Implemented support for three recognized GPA systems to make the feature useful for both York University requirements and external application contexts.
* Added weighted GPA support so cumulative calculations reflect course credit differences correctly.
* Ensured the same conversion logic can be reused for both actual grades and hypothetical what-if projections.
* Boundary-value testing was important for preventing ambiguity around grade cutoffs such as 79.4% versus 79.5%.
* No major blockers were encountered during implementation.

### ITR2-4 — Course Evaluation & Rule Modeling

([SCRUM-106](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-106))

**Story Owner:** Bardiya Ameri  
**Planned Effort:** 1 day (6 hours)  
**Actual Effort:** 8 hours

#### Story Description

As a student, I want the system to evaluate my course performance using York University’s specific grading rules, so that I can understand my academic standing through letter grades, grade points, and realistic projections of what is required to hit my targets.

#### Scope (ITR2)

* Institutional grading logic:
  * Map calculated percentages to the YorkU 9-point scale.
  * Generate structured evaluation results including:
    * Letter grade
    * Grade point value
    * Performance descriptor

* Target feasibility analysis:
  * Calculate the exact average required on remaining coursework to achieve a user-defined target.

* Dynamic difficulty classification:
  * Categorize the target as:
    * Comfortable
    * Achievable
    * Challenging
    * Very Challenging
    * Not Possible
    * Already Achieved

* Engine integrity:
  * Ensure the evaluation engine is deterministic and read-only.
  * Prevent evaluation logic from mutating or overwriting stored course data.
  * Keep the evaluation engine fully independent of AI components.
  * Handle edge cases such as:
    * 0% remaining weight
    * target already met
    * required averages above 100%

* Stability and integration:
  * Maintain compatibility with the ITR1 in-memory stub database.
  * Ensure numerical stability and consistent rounding at boundary thresholds.

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

* Support for grading systems beyond York University’s 9-point scale.
* Saving evaluation history or trend tracking over time.
* Institution-specific grading customization by the user.
* Advanced advisory recommendations beyond rule-based difficulty classification.

([SCRUM-91](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-91))

**Story Owner:** Rima Ramcharan  
**Planned Effort:** 5–6 days  
**Actual Effort:** 6 days

#### Story Description

As a student, I want an interactive dashboard that models my best and worst-case grade scenarios and suggests specific study techniques, so that I can strategically prioritize my efforts and trust the accuracy of the system’s projections through transparent calculations.

#### Scope (ITR2)

* Interactive planning dashboard:
  * Create a central dashboard view showing current progress, remaining assessments, and projected outcomes.
  * Present grade-related information in a clear, student-friendly format.

* Grade boundary modeling:
  * Calculate and display worst-case scenarios, such as the minimum scores needed to pass or reach a target.
  * Calculate and display best-case scenarios, such as the maximum possible final grade based on remaining assessments.

* Calculation transparency:
  * Include a “Show Calculations” toggle or expandable section for each estimate.
  * Display the underlying weighted-average math used to generate projections.

* Smart learning strategies:
  * Suggest study strategies based on assessment importance and remaining time.
  * Include techniques such as:
    * 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)
    * Active Recall
    * Spaced Repetition
    * Feynman Technique

* Dynamic updating:
  * Update projections immediately when the user enters what-if scores.
  * Ensure hypothetical inputs do not overwrite actual stored grades.
  * Continue functioning even when course weights do not yet sum to 100%.

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

* AI-personalized study recommendations based on learning history.
* Automatic calendar-based study scheduling.

### ITR2-6 — Smart Deadline Management (OCR + Manual Entry + Calendar Sync)

([SCRUM-82](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-82))

**Story Owner:** Shadi Karimpour  
**Planned Effort:** 4–5 days  
**Actual Effort:** 4 days

#### Story Description

As a student, I want my assignment and test deadlines to be automatically extracted from my course outline, but also be able to manually add or edit them, so that I have full control over my deadlines and never miss anything due to OCR errors or missing information.

#### Scope (ITR2)

* Use OCR to extract assessment names, due dates, and times (if available) from uploaded course outlines.
* Display all detected deadlines in an editable list view.
* Allow users to:

  * edit any deadline (name, date, time, type, notes)
  * delete incorrect entries
  * add new deadlines manually at any time
* If OCR detects no deadlines, show a clear empty state with an “Add Deadline” button.
* Include a review and confirm step before exporting deadlines to Google Calendar.
* Allow users to export selected or all deadlines to Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.
* Exported events include:

  * course name + assessment title
  * due date/time
  * automatic reminder 1 week before the due date
  * minimum grade needed (if calculated) in the event description
* Show a countdown display on the dashboard for upcoming deadlines.
* Mark deadlines with a badge such as “From Outline” or “Manual” for clarity.
* Prevent duplicate exports of the same deadline.

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

* Advanced recurring deadline logic for repeated academic tasks.
* Support for external calendar providers beyond Google Calendar.
* Full natural-language deadline extraction from highly ambiguous course outlines.
* Smart prioritization or scheduling recommendations based on workload and time remaining.

#### Development Tasks & Assignments

1. Backend: Deadline management, OCR parsing, and calendar integration

   * Assignee: Kartik ([SCRUM-83](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-83))
   * Status: DONE

2. Frontend: Deadline management UI, review flow, and countdown display

   * Assignee: Shadi ([SCRUM-84](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-84))

3. Frontend: UI/UX design in Figma

   * Assignee: Shadi ([SCRUM-132](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-132))

4. Database: Deadline storage and calendar sync schema

   * Assignee: Himanshi ([SCRUM-85](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-85))

5. Testing: Unit & integration tests for deadline flow

   * Assignee: Bardiya ([SCRUM-86](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-86))

6. Docs: Update `log.md` for deadline feature architecture, API endpoints, and flow

   * Assignee: Shadi ([SCRUM-87](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-87))

##### SCRUM-83 Implementation Summary (Backend — Kartik)

- `models_deadline.py` (77 lines): Pydantic schemas — `Deadline`, `DeadlineCreate`, `DeadlineUpdate`, `DeadlineExportRequest`, `DeadlineExportResponse`, `GoogleAuthUrlResponse`.
- `services/deadline_service.py` (573 lines): Deadline CRUD orchestration, OCR-based deadline extraction with lightweight date parser (regex for month-name, numeric, and time patterns), ICS calendar generation (RFC-5545 compliant, zero external dependencies), Google Calendar integration via stdlib `urllib` (OAuth2 flow, event creation with 1-week reminders, duplicate prevention via `gcal_event_id`). Graceful 501 fallback when Google credentials are not configured.
- `routes/deadlines.py` (333 lines): 10 FastAPI endpoints — extract from outline, CRUD (list/create/update/delete), ICS download, Google Calendar export, Google OAuth2 authorize + callback.
- `test_deadline_endpoints.py` (303 lines): Integration tests covering CRUD, extraction, export, and error handling.
- Total: ~1,286 lines of backend code + tests.

#### Notes / Reflection

* Combined OCR-based extraction with manual deadline management to reduce user effort while still allowing full control over deadline data.
* Added editable deadline review flow so extracted results can be corrected before being used or exported.
* Integrated countdown display to improve visibility of upcoming academic tasks directly in the dashboard.
* Designed the feature so manually added deadlines and OCR-detected deadlines behave consistently across editing, display, and export flows.
* Google Calendar integration required careful handling of event export behavior and duplicate prevention logic.
* No major blockers were encountered during this story.

## 4. Major Design Decisions (ITR2)

During Iteration 2, the team made the following major architectural and design decisions:

### 1. Repository Abstraction with Runtime-Switchable Persistence

A repository abstraction layer was introduced so that business logic remains independent of the storage implementation. The system can switch between the in-memory stub database and PostgreSQL through configuration.

This decision allowed the team to support both fast development/testing and persistent runtime storage without duplicating service logic.

### 2. User-Scoped Data Isolation

Authentication and persistence were designed around user-scoped data access. Backend routes resolve the authenticated user through cookie-based JWT authentication, and repository operations for courses, deadlines, and scenarios are scoped by `user_id`.

This ensures that users can only access and modify their own data and prevents cross-user access at the backend level.

### 3. Shared Setup Flow with Central Course Context

The setup pages were designed around a shared setup layout and a centralized course context provider. This layout handles common concerns such as authentication checks, the shared header, the course selector, and step navigation.

This decision reduced duplication across pages and kept the setup flow consistent across multiple course-related screens.

### 4. Modular AI-Assisted Extraction Pipeline with Confirm-Before-Save

The automatic extraction feature was designed as a modular backend pipeline with separate stages for ingestion, normalization, validation, diagnostics, and orchestration. Extracted data is not saved automatically; users must explicitly review and confirm it before persistence.

This improved maintainability and robustness while preventing incorrect OCR or AI-generated output from being stored directly.

### 5. Hierarchical Assessment Modeling

The grading model was extended to support parent-child assessments, rule metadata, and nested score persistence. Backend grading logic was designed to operate correctly on hierarchical grading structures rather than assuming all assessments are flat.

This allowed the application to support more realistic course grading schemes and laid the foundation for future advanced rule handling.

### 6. UI-Agnostic GPA Conversion Engine

The GPA conversion module was designed as a stateless, UI-agnostic engine: the service accepts a raw percentage and returns structured grade data (letter, grade point, description) without any coupling to the frontend or persistence layer. Three internationally recognized scales (4.0 OMSAS, 9.0 York, 10.0 International) are defined as static band tables evaluated with inclusive lower-bound matching.

This decision allows the conversion logic to be reused across single-course GPA, what-if projections, and cumulative GPA calculations without duplication, and makes it straightforward to add new scales in future iterations.

## 5. Concerns / Issues (ITR2)

* No major group conflicts occurred during Iteration 2.
* Some integration work required extra coordination between backend, frontend, and database components due to the larger scope of persistence and extraction features.
* A few features were implemented in a phased manner, where backend functionality was completed before full frontend refinement.
* Minor adjustments were needed during testing to align persistence behavior, extraction flow, and multi-course interactions.
* No critical blockers prevented completion of the main ITR2 goals.

## 6. Iteration Summary (ITR2)

Total number of user stories implemented: 7

During Iteration 2, the team expanded Evalio from a stub-based single-course prototype into a more complete planning system with persistence, extraction, multi-course support, evaluation modeling, and deadline management.

The team successfully delivered:

* Persistent multi-course storage with repository abstraction and PostgreSQL support
* Automatic course outline extraction with editable confirmation flow
* Universal GPA Converter with three recognized scales (4.0 OMSAS, 9.0 York, 10.0 International), including single-course GPA, what-if GPA projections, and cumulative GPA calculation
* YorkU-based evaluation and rule modeling
* Interactive dashboard and multi-course management improvements
* Smart deadline management with OCR/manual support, ICS export, and Google Calendar integration
* User-scoped authentication and protected course access
* Expanded backend/frontend integration across newly added features
* Improved test coverage with both unit and integration testing

Overall, Iteration 2 introduced significantly more architectural complexity than Iteration 1, especially through persistence, extraction, authentication, and multi-feature integration. Despite this, the main ITR2 goals were completed and the project progressed toward a more realistic end-to-end system.

The system is now substantially more complete than in ITR1, with stronger persistence, richer workflows, and better support for real student planning across multiple sessions and multiple courses.
