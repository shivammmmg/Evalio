### ITR1-5 — Minimum Required Score Calculation

([SCRUM-59](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-59))

**Story Owner:** Rima  
**Planned Effort:** 8 hours  
**Actual Effort:** 6 hours

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to know the minimum score I need on a remaining assessment to achieve a target final grade, so that I can plan my effort realistically.

#### Scope (ITR1)

- User provides a target final grade (0–100)
- System calculates the minimum required score on ONE remaining assessment
- Calculation assumes all other remaining assessments receive maximum possible scores (100%).
- Assumes all other remaining assessments receive maximum possible scores
- If the required score is above 100, the target is marked as not achievable
- Uses stub / in-memory data only

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

- Multiple remaining assessments at once
- Strategy recommendations
- Saving or comparing targets

##### Development Tasks & Assignments

1. Backend: Calculate minimum required score for target grade (SCRUM-60)

   - Assignee: Kartik

2. Backend: API endpoint for minimum required score (SCRUM-61)

   - Assignee: Kartik

3. Frontend: Minimum required score display (SCRUM-62)

#### Notes / Reflection

- **Design Decision:** Implemented an "Optimistic Projection" model. This assumes the user will achieve 100% on all other future assessments to calculate the absolute minimum effort required for the selected task.
- **Frontend Integration:** Linked the calculation to the Dashboard Assessment Breakdown, ensuring that if a target is mathematically impossible (>100% required), the UI clearly flags the goal as "Not Achievable."
- **Edge Cases:** Handled scenarios where a user has already achieved their target grade before all assessments are completed.

### ITR1-6 — What-If Scenario Analysis (Stretch)

([SCRUM-65](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-65))

**Story Owner:** Bardiya  
**Planned Effort:** 6 hours  
**Actual Effort:** 8 hours

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to temporarily try a hypothetical score on a remaining assessment,  
so that I can see how it would affect my final grade.

#### Scope (ITR1 – Stretch)

- User inputs **ONE** hypothetical score for **ONE** remaining assessment
- System calculates projected grade impact using existing weighted-grade logic
- Hypothetical data is **NOT saved or persisted** (read-only analysis)
- Uses stub / in-memory data only

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

- Multiple what-if scenarios
- Saving/comparing scenarios
- Charts/projections
- Natural language / AI inputs

#### Development Tasks & Assignments

1. Backend: Add what-if scenario calculation function (read-only; no persistence)

   - Assignee: Kartik

2. Backend: Add API endpoint for what-if scenario analysis (`/courses/{course_index}/whatif`)

   - Assignee: Kartik

3. Tests: Unit tests for what-if scenario logic

   - Assignee: Bardiya

4. Docs: Update log.md to mark this story as a stretch feature and document the no-persistence decision

   - Assignee: Bardiya

5. Frontend: What-if input (slider or number) and result display (Explore Scenarios page), and UX/UI Design
   - Assignee: Shadi

#### Notes / Reflection

- **Design decision (scope control):** hypothetical values are intentionally **not persisted** in ITR1.
- Implemented as read-only scenario analysis using existing standing/weight calculations.
- Main work on this story was split: **backend implementation by Kartik**, and **tests + documentation by Bardiya**.

## 4. Major Design Decisions

During Iteration 1, the team made the following architectural and design decisions:

### 1. Three-Layer Architecture

The system was structured using a three-layer architecture:

- UI Layer (Frontend)
- Business Logic Layer
- Data Layer (Stub Database)

This separation ensures clear responsibilities and prevents business logic from being placed inside the UI.

### 2. Stub Database with Interface

A database interface was created along with a stub (in-memory) implementation.
This allows the system to switch to a real persistent database in future iterations with minimal changes.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

- Business logic (grade calculations, feasibility logic) was implemented strictly in the service layer.
- UI layer is responsible only for user input and displaying results.
- Data layer handles storage via stub implementation.

### 4. Unit Testing Strategy

Unit tests were written for domain and business logic classes.
Database-dependent logic was tested using the stub implementation.

### 5. Controlled Scope for Iteration 1

Advanced grading rules and persistent database were intentionally deferred to later iterations to maintain focus on core functionality.

### 6. Grading Validation Rules (SCRUM-45)

The following validation rules were implemented for grading structure integrity:

**Assessment Weight Validation:**

- Weights must be non-negative (≥ 0)
- Total weight must equal exactly 100%
- Each assessment must have a unique name

**Grade Entry Validation:**

- Grades must be numeric values
- Raw score must be ≥ 0
- Total score must be > 0
- Raw score cannot exceed total score
- Both raw_score and total_score must be provided together, or both null

**What-If Scenario Validation (SCRUM-66/67):**

- Hypothetical scores must be between 0-100%
- Assessment must exist and be ungraded
- Read-only operation - does not persist data

**Minimum Required Score Validation (SCRUM-60/61):**

- Target must be between 0-100%
- Assessment must exist and be ungraded
- Returns `is_achievable: false` if required score exceeds 100%

## 5. Concerns / Issues

- No major group conflicts occurred during Iteration 1.
- Initial time estimates for some stories were higher than actual effort required.
- Minor integration adjustments were needed between backend and frontend components.
- No critical blockers affected completion of ITR1 stories.

## 6. Iteration Summary

Total number of user stories implemented: 6

All planned ITR1 user stories were completed within the iteration timeline.

Overall planned effort aligned closely with actual effort, with some stories completed faster than estimated.

The team successfully delivered:

- Domain models
- Stub database implementation
- Basic GUI for ITR1 stories
- Unit tests for business logic
- Structured Jira tracking

Iteration 1 goals were met successfully, and the system remains stable with no major defects.

### ITR2-2 — Persistent Multi-Course Planning System (DB + Multi-Course Support)

SCRUM-96

**Story Owner:** Himanshi Verma
**Planned Effort:** 4–5 days
**Actual Effort:** 5 days

#### Story Description

As a student, when I manage my courses, I want my courses, grades, and what-if scenarios to be saved permanently so that I can track and plan my academic performance across sessions without losing data between sessions.

#### Scope (ITR2)

- Course persistence:
  - Courses and their structures are stored in a persistent database.
  - The system saves course data including assessments, grading rules, and weights.
  - Saved courses are automatically loaded when the application restarts.
  - Students can edit and delete previously saved courses.
  - Course data remains consistent when reloaded.
- Score and scenario persistence:
  - Entered grades for assessments are saved in the database.
  - Students can update and delete stored scores.
  - What-If scenarios can be saved and labeled.
  - Saved scenarios can be reloaded without overwriting actual grades.
  - The system recalculates grades and feasibility correctly after loading persisted data.
- Multi-course planning:
  Students can create and manage multiple courses.
  The application provides a course overview page showing:
- Course name
- Current grade
- Target grade
- Feasibility status
  Students can switch between courses without losing data.
  Deleting a course removes all related data using cascading delete rules.
- Dual database support:
  - The system supports both an in-memory stub database and a PostgreSQL database.
  - Repository abstraction allows switching between the two implementations.
  - Database switching is controlled through configuration.
  - PostgreSQL initialization scripts are included.
  - Integration tests verify correct persistence behaviour.

#### Development Tasks & Assignments

#### Notes / Reflection

- Implemented a repository abstraction layer to support both the stub database and PostgreSQL without changing business logic.
- Designed a relational database schema to persist courses, assessments, scores, scenarios, and deadlines.
- Added referential integrity constraints and cascading deletes to maintain consistent data relationships.
- Implemented multi-course support allowing students to create and switch between multiple courses without data loss.
- Integration tests verified that data persists after application restart and that switching between stub and PostgreSQL works correctly.
- No major blockers were encountered during development.

### ITR2-4 — Course Evaluation & Rule Modeling

([SCRUM-106](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-106))

**Story Owner:** Bardiya Ameri  
**Planned Effort:** 4 days  
**Actual Effort:** 3 day

#### Story Description

As a student, I want the system to evaluate my course performance using York University’s specific grading rules,  
so that I can understand my academic standing through letter grades, grade points, and realistic projections of what is required to hit my targets.

#### Scope (ITR2)

- Institutional grading logic:
  - Map calculated percentages to the YorkU 9-point scale (A+ = 9, A = 8, etc.)
  - Return structured results including:
    - Letter grade
    - Grade point value
    - Performance descriptor (e.g., Exceptional, Excellent, Good)
- Target feasibility analysis:
  - Calculate the exact average required on remaining coursework to achieve a user-defined target
- Dynamic difficulty classification:
  - Categorize the target as:
    - Comfortable
    - Achievable
    - Challenging
    - Very Challenging
    - Not Possible
    - Already Achieved
    - Complete (when remaining weight is 0)
- Engine integrity:
  - Deterministic and read-only (evaluations must not mutate or overwrite stored grade data)
  - Independent of AI components to ensure mathematical correctness
- Stability & integration:
  - Maintain compatibility with the in-memory stub database
  - Ensure consistent rounding and stable output at boundary thresholds (e.g., 79.5% vs 80.0%)

#### Development Tasks & Assignments (SCRUM-106)

- Backend: Evaluation & rule modeling engine

  - Assignee: Kartik
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-112)

- Frontend: Evaluation results UI

  - Assignee: Shadi
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-115)

- Frontend: UI/UX design support

  - Assignee: Shadi
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-130)

- Database: Support evaluation data/model compatibility

  - Assignee: Himanshi
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-116)

- Testing: Unit & integration tests for evaluation logic

  - Assignee: Bardiya
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-117)

- Docs: Update log.md & technical notes
  - Assignee: Bardiya
  - Status: TO DO (SCRUM-118)

#### Key Design Decisions / Notes

- Deterministic + AI-independent engine: evaluation is purely mathematical for correctness and reproducibility.
- Read-only analysis: evaluation outputs do not overwrite real grades; repeated calls produce consistent results.
- Boundary handling: YorkU thresholds and rounding rules were designed to avoid drift at cutoffs (e.g., 79.5 vs 80.0).
- Edge cases covered:
  - Remaining weight = 0 → classification “Complete”
  - Target already met → classification “Already Achieved”
  - Required average > 100 → classification “Not Possible”

#### Testing Summary (SCRUM-117)

Automated tests verify:

- YorkU boundary mappings and rounding thresholds.
- Required remaining average math for partially graded courses.
- Difficulty classification threshold correctness.
- Non-mutation guarantees (analysis endpoints do not modify stored course data).
- Repeat-call stability (same inputs yield the same results).

#### Out of Scope / Future Work

- Institution-specific grading scale configuration.
- Saving evaluation history and trends over time.
- Advanced strategy engine beyond rule-based difficulty labels.
- Additional UI visualization for showing calculation steps (if prioritized).

### ITR2-5 — Interactive Strategy Dashboard (Grade Boundaries + Calculation Transparency + Learning Optimization)

SCRUM-91

**Story Owner:** Rima Ramcharan
**Planned Effort:** 5–6 days
**Actual Effort:** 6 days

#### Story Description

As a student, I want an interactive dashboard that models my best and worst-case grade scenarios and suggests specific study techniques, so that I can strategically prioritize my efforts and trust the accuracy of the system’s projections through transparent calculations.

#### Scope (ITR2)

- Interactive Planning Dashboard:
  - Central hub visualizing current progress, weighted contributions, and projected final grades.
  - Integration of "What-If" sliders to adjust performance assumptions dynamically.
- Grade Boundary Modeling:
  - Calculation and display of "Worst-Case" (minimum needed to pass/hit target) and "Best-Case" (max possible grade) scenarios.
- Calculation Transparency:
  - "Show Calculations" toggle to reveal weighted average formulas and underlying math.
  - Transparent breakdown of how each assessment contributes to the final standing.
- Smart Learning Strategies:
  - Integration of a recommendation engine suggesting specific techniques (80/20 Rule, Active Recall, Feynman Technique) based on assessment weight and remaining time.
- Dynamic Updating:
  - Projections and boundaries update immediately as the user explores "what-if" scores without overwriting actual saved grades.
  - System handles incomplete syllabi where total weight may not yet sum to 100%.
