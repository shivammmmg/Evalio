## 2. Plan Review (ITR0 → ITR1)

At the beginning of Iteration 1, the team reviewed the planning document produced in Iteration 0, including the vision statement, big user stories, and detailed user stories for ITR1.

After evaluation, the team determined that no major changes to scope, priorities, or user stories were required.

The ITR1 user stories were feasible within the iteration timeline and remained aligned with the customer’s validated priorities.

No stories were added, removed, or significantly modified between ITR0 and ITR1.

The team proceeded with implementation according to the original plan.

## 3. Task Assignment & Work Breakdown (ITR1)

During Iteration 1, each user story was assigned to one primary owner.
Development tasks were further broken down and assigned to team members.
Time estimates and actual effort were tracked for accountability.

### User Story: ITR1-1 — Manual Course Setup (Assessments + Weights)

- Integrated frontend with backend API for grade submission and reset functionality.
- No major blockers were encountered during development.

### ITR1-4 — Target Grade Feasibility  
([SCRUM-53](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-53))

**Story Owner:** Shivam  
**Planned Effort:** 7 hours  
**Actual Effort:** 4 hours

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to enter a target final grade so that I can know whether it is achievable based on my current progress.

#### Scope (ITR1)

- User enters a target final grade (0–100)
- System determines whether the target is achievable
- Calculation is based on:
  - Current grades
  - Remaining assessments
  - Maximum possible scores
- Result returned as simple Yes/No with explanation
- Uses stub / in-memory data only

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

- Suggested strategies to reach the target
- Visual projections or charts
- Saving target history

### ITR1-5 — Minimum Required Score Calculation  
([SCRUM-59](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-59))

**Story Owner:** Rima  
**Planned Effort:** 8 hours  
**Actual Effort:** 6 hours

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to know the minimum score I need on a remaining assessment to achieve a target final grade, so that I can plan my effort realistically.

#### Scope (ITR1)

- User provides a target final grade (0–100)
- System calculates the minimum required score on ONE remaining assessment
- Calculation assumes all other remaining assessments receive maximum possible scores (100%).
- Assumes all other remaining assessments receive maximum possible scores
- If the required score is above 100, the target is marked as not achievable
- Uses stub / in-memory data only

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

- Multiple remaining assessments at once
- Strategy recommendations
- Saving or comparing targets

##### Development Tasks & Assignments

1. Backend: Calculate minimum required score for target grade (SCRUM-60)

   - Assignee: Kartik

2. Backend: API endpoint for minimum required score (SCRUM-61)

   - Assignee: Kartik

3. Frontend: Minimum required score display (SCRUM-62)

   - Assignee: Rima

4. Tests: Unit tests for minimum required logic (SCRUM-63)

   - Assignee: Bardiya

5. Docs: Update log.md for minimum required score logic (SCRUM-64)
   - Assignee: Rima

#### Notes / Reflection

- **Design Decision:** Implemented an "Optimistic Projection" model. This assumes the user will achieve 100% on all other future assessments to calculate the absolute minimum effort required for the selected task.
- **Frontend Integration:** Linked the calculation to the Dashboard Assessment Breakdown, ensuring that if a target is mathematically impossible (>100% required), the UI clearly flags the goal as "Not Achievable."
- **Edge Cases:** Handled scenarios where a user has already achieved their target grade before all assessments are completed.

### ITR1-6 — What-If Scenario Analysis (Stretch)  
([SCRUM-65](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-65))

**Story Owner:** Bardiya  
**Planned Effort:** 6 hours  
**Actual Effort:** 8 hours

#### Story Description

As a student, I want to temporarily try a hypothetical score on a remaining assessment,  
so that I can see how it would affect my final grade.

#### Scope (ITR1 – Stretch)

- User inputs **ONE** hypothetical score for **ONE** remaining assessment
- System calculates projected grade impact using existing weighted-grade logic
- Hypothetical data is **NOT saved or persisted** (read-only analysis)
- Uses stub / in-memory data only

#### Out of Scope (Future Iterations)

- Multiple what-if scenarios
- Saving/comparing scenarios
- Charts/projections
- Natural language / AI inputs

#### Development Tasks & Assignments

1. Backend: Add what-if scenario calculation function (read-only; no persistence)

   - Assignee: Kartik

2. Backend: Add API endpoint for what-if scenario analysis (`/courses/{course_index}/whatif`)

   - Assignee: Kartik

3. Tests: Unit tests for what-if scenario logic

   - Assignee: Bardiya

4. Docs: Update log.md to mark this story as a stretch feature and document the no-persistence decision
   - Assignee: Bardiya

5. Frontend: What-if input (slider or number) and result display (Explore Scenarios page), and UX/UI Design
   - Assignee: Shadi

#### Notes / Reflection

- **Design decision (scope control):** hypothetical values are intentionally **not persisted** in ITR1.
- Implemented as read-only scenario analysis using existing standing/weight calculations.
- Main work on this story was split: **backend implementation by Kartik**, and **tests + documentation by Bardiya**.

## 4. Major Design Decisions

During Iteration 1, the team made the following architectural and design decisions:

### 1. Three-Layer Architecture

The system was structured using a three-layer architecture:

- UI Layer (Frontend)
- Business Logic Layer
- Data Layer (Stub Database)

This separation ensures clear responsibilities and prevents business logic from being placed inside the UI.

### 2. Stub Database with Interface

A database interface was created along with a stub (in-memory) implementation.
This allows the system to switch to a real persistent database in future iterations with minimal changes.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

- Business logic (grade calculations, feasibility logic) was implemented strictly in the service layer.
- UI layer is responsible only for user input and displaying results.
- Data layer handles storage via stub implementation.

### 4. Unit Testing Strategy

Unit tests were written for domain and business logic classes.
Database-dependent logic was tested using the stub implementation.

### 5. Controlled Scope for Iteration 1

Advanced grading rules and persistent database were intentionally deferred to later iterations to maintain focus on core functionality.

### 6. Grading Validation Rules (SCRUM-45)

The following validation rules were implemented for grading structure integrity:

**Assessment Weight Validation:**

- Weights must be non-negative (≥ 0)
- Total weight must equal exactly 100%
- Each assessment must have a unique name

**Grade Entry Validation:**

- Grades must be numeric values
- Raw score must be ≥ 0
- Total score must be > 0
- Raw score cannot exceed total score
- Both raw_score and total_score must be provided together, or both null

**What-If Scenario Validation (SCRUM-66/67):**

- Hypothetical scores must be between 0-100%
- Assessment must exist and be ungraded
- Read-only operation - does not persist data

**Minimum Required Score Validation (SCRUM-60/61):**

- Target must be between 0-100%
- Assessment must exist and be ungraded
- Returns `is_achievable: false` if required score exceeds 100%

## 5. Concerns / Issues

- No major group conflicts occurred during Iteration 1.
- Initial time estimates for some stories were higher than actual effort required.
- Minor integration adjustments were needed between backend and frontend components.
- No critical blockers affected completion of ITR1 stories.

## 6. Iteration Summary

Total number of user stories implemented: 6

All planned ITR1 user stories were completed within the iteration timeline.

Overall planned effort aligned closely with actual effort, with some stories completed faster than estimated.

The team successfully delivered:

- Domain models
- Stub database implementation
- Basic GUI for ITR1 stories
- Unit tests for business logic
- Structured Jira tracking

Iteration 1 goals were met successfully, and the system remains stable with no major defects.

### ITR2-4 — Course Evaluation & Rule Modeling  
([SCRUM-106](https://rimaaa.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-106))

**Story Owner:** Bardiya Ameri  
**Planned Effort:** 4 days  
**Actual Effort:** 3 day  

#### Story Description

As a student, I want the system to evaluate my course performance using York University’s specific grading rules,  
so that I can understand my academic standing through letter grades, grade points, and realistic projections of what is required to hit my targets.

#### Scope (ITR2)

- Institutional grading logic:
  - Map calculated percentages to the YorkU 9-point scale (A+ = 9, A = 8, etc.)
  - Return structured results including:
    - Letter grade
    - Grade point value
    - Performance descriptor (e.g., Exceptional, Excellent, Good)
- Target feasibility analysis:
  - Calculate the exact average required on remaining coursework to achieve a user-defined target
- Dynamic difficulty classification:
  - Categorize the target as:
    - Comfortable
    - Achievable
    - Challenging
    - Very Challenging
    - Not Possible
    - Already Achieved
    - Complete (when remaining weight is 0)
- Engine integrity:
  - Deterministic and read-only (evaluations must not mutate or overwrite stored grade data)
  - Independent of AI components to ensure mathematical correctness
- Stability & integration:
  - Maintain compatibility with the in-memory stub database
  - Ensure consistent rounding and stable output at boundary thresholds (e.g., 79.5% vs 80.0%)

#### Development Tasks & Assignments (SCRUM-106)

- Backend: Evaluation & rule modeling engine  
  - Assignee: Kartik  
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-112)

- Frontend: Evaluation results UI  
  - Assignee: Shadi  
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-115)

- Frontend: UI/UX design support  
  - Assignee: Shadi  
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-130)

- Database: Support evaluation data/model compatibility  
  - Assignee: Himanshi  
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-116)

- Testing: Unit & integration tests for evaluation logic  
  - Assignee: Bardiya  
  - Status: DONE (SCRUM-117)

- Docs: Update log.md & technical notes  
  - Assignee: Bardiya  
  - Status: TO DO (SCRUM-118)

#### Key Design Decisions / Notes

- Deterministic + AI-independent engine: evaluation is purely mathematical for correctness and reproducibility.
- Read-only analysis: evaluation outputs do not overwrite real grades; repeated calls produce consistent results.
- Boundary handling: YorkU thresholds and rounding rules were designed to avoid drift at cutoffs (e.g., 79.5 vs 80.0).
- Edge cases covered:
  - Remaining weight = 0 → classification “Complete”
  - Target already met → classification “Already Achieved”
  - Required average > 100 → classification “Not Possible”

#### Testing Summary (SCRUM-117)

Automated tests verify:
- YorkU boundary mappings and rounding thresholds.
- Required remaining average math for partially graded courses.
- Difficulty classification threshold correctness.
- Non-mutation guarantees (analysis endpoints do not modify stored course data).
- Repeat-call stability (same inputs yield the same results).

#### Out of Scope / Future Work

- Institution-specific grading scale configuration.
- Saving evaluation history and trends over time.
- Advanced strategy engine beyond rule-based difficulty labels.
- Additional UI visualization for showing calculation steps (if prioritized).
